myPokedex
=========

My Winter Break side project. A data-driven visualization project of Pokemon! Stay tuned!

This application will be built using Yeoman (Yo + Grunt + Bower). I have yet to decide which front-end frameworks to use, but I'm looking at Topcoat or Ionic. On the client side, I'm looking to use Angular. I'll most likely be using MongoDB and Node.js for the backend.
